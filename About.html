<h4 style="color:white;">
After taking said Personality test it game me the results of being a Virtuoso.<br>
Which the description of a Virtuoso is a person that is used to experiencing the world around them hands on,<br>
people who usually are a virtuoso are natural creates. They typically create things just for the fun of it and <br>sometimes go beyond their goal just because it's fun. 
<br><br>
With the basic defenition of this personality type being a persowho's pasionate and almost always exeding expectations. <br>I feel that this really isn't my persoanlity type. It got the part where I sometimes do more of something just because it's fun,<br> but that almost never works out, plus im not the best when it comes to being creative and detailed with projects. <br>
But the graph that it shows along side it is a bit more accurate that the direct descirption of a virtuoso.
