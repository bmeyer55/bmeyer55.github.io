    <h1>This Is Going To Be A Lot Harder Than I Thought</h1>
    <p>
        Why am I taking CSP? To he complety honest I'm just trying to find something that I can enjoy. I've always found computers to be interesting <br> 
        and wondered exactly how they work. I thought that this was going to be easy but it's a lot harder to just learn the basics than I thought.<br> 
        After i'm done taking this class I hope to have an expanded knowledge of coding and potential go to college to continue in studying in coding.<br>
        I was bored during 2nd period so I decided to make a little bit of info about one of friend, don't worry he said I could make it.
